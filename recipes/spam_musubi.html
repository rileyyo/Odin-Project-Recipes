    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spam musubi is a snack and lunch food composed of a slice of grilled Spam sandwiched either in between or on top of a block of rice, wrapped together with nori in the tradition of Japanese onigiri. <br>
        Inexpensive and portable, Spam musubi are commonly found near cash registers in convenience stores or mom-and-pop shops all over Hawaii, the Marianas[citation needed] and Hawaiian barbecue restaurants in the mainland United States

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve musubi warm or chilled.
