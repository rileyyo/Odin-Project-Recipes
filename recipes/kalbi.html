    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Kalbi is a staple of Korean fine dining but is too expensive in restaurants. .</strong> 
        It is simple to make at home with beef short ribs and a sweet and savory sesame and soy sauce marinade. 
        It's traditionally served sliced, rolled in romaine lettuce leaves with white rice, lightly browned garlic slices, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).

            Gather the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, water, green onions, garlic, and sesame oil together in a bowl until sugar has dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place ribs in a large resealable plastic bag; pour in marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil the grate. Remove ribs from the bag; shake off excess marinade and discard marinade. 
            Grill ribs on the preheated grill until meat is still pink but not bloody nearest the bone, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
